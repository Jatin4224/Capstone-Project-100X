lesson 1-> making components

//////part 1
Installation of tailwind css (INDEPENDENT OF ANY FRAMEWORK)
-the simplest way and fastest way to get up and running with tailwind CSS from scratch is with the tailwind CLI tool.

step 1)create two folders
1)src means source
2)dist means distributables
why we need dist?
-how tailwind work is basically it will compile the configuration and whatever things u provide and then it will basically make sure the style ur using in the production only those style will go into the production build thats why we keep it seprate.
this is famous feature of tailwind also known as tailwind perge.

step2)
terminal command->
-npx tailwindcss init

tailwind.config.js

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} \*/
module.exports = {
content: ["./src/**/\*.{html,js}"],
theme: {
extend: {},
},
plugins: [],
}

3)create file where u will manage all your css

file name-
-input.css

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

->Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS file.

step 4)Start the Tailwind CLI build process
Run the CLI tool to scan your template files for classes and build your CSS.

terminal->
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch

//cool extensions and imp too
-(1) live server by ritwick Dey
-(2) Tailwind CSS intesilence by tailwind labs coolestx10
-(3) tailwind Docs - if u install this u can do command shift > and u can search in your vs code so u dont have to switch from browser to vs code
but this one its not recommended by siddhant because vs code has some issues with it

///// part 2 - intro to capstone

-atomic design
whenever u start a house u cannot build everything u start building by smallest unit same applys for ui in our case the smallest component is buttons this are the building blocks of the project.

->learn about figma dev mode calculating padding width etc makes easy
-> in real world too u will get colour paletss in figma with the color code this is given by designer

Note -
when u want to use some color but not available in tailwind so this is where taialwind config comes
open th config file update the code
example- we want to add color neutral-50:#f9f9f9

extend: {
colors: {
"neutral-50":"#f9f9f9"
}
}
-this is how u extend the design system in the tailwind thats why tailwind is the most customizable framework

->how to know attribute is missing ?
-you have to search on tailwind docs

-in figma file suppose 0.5 rem 0.5rem is given .how will i get to know which class is to use for 0.5 rem ?
->search 0.5rem on docs u will see we have py-2 class which add on top and bottm 0.5rem

->offical way to use the tailwind is basically go to tailwind UI website
-> free resources

- wickedblocks.dev
- preline UI
- TailGrids
- Flowbite
- tailwind css debug screens -> which will help in designing layouts

// lesson 2 -> Building UI components & Introduction to Capstone Project.

2.how to apply tailwind
3.how to do the theming
4.how to build a UI library
